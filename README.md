AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br>
WHEN I view the UV index<br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity<br>
